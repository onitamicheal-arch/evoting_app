## Development Status

### âœ… Completed Backend Architecture
- Complete database design with SQLite
- Authentication system with biometric support
- Voting system with security features
- Admin panel functionality
- State management with Provider
- Routing and navigation

### ðŸ”„ UI Implementation Needed
The following screens need full implementation:

1. **Registration Screen**: Complete form with validation
2. **Home Screen**: Dashboard showing available elections
3. **Voting Screen**: Party selection and voting interface
4. **Vote Confirmation**: Final vote confirmation
5. **Results Screen**: Election results display
6. **Admin Screens**: Full admin panel interface

### ðŸ“± Currently Available
- âœ… Splash Screen: Complete with loading animation
- âœ… Login Screen: Full implementation with biometric support
- ðŸ”„ Other screens: Basic placeholders implemented

## Security Implementation

1. **Authentication Security**:
   - SHA-256 password hashing
   - Device biometric verification
   - Two-step authentication process

2. **Vote Security**:
   - Cryptographic integrity verification
   - One vote per user per election
   - Secure vote storage

3. **Data Protection**:
   - Local SQLite database
   - Proper database relationships
   - Input validation and sanitization

## Usage Guide

### For Voters
1. Register with personal details and VIN
2. Login with surname/password + biometric
3. Vote in available elections
4. View results when released

### For Administrators
1. Login with admin credentials
2. Create and manage elections
3. Add/remove parties and candidates
4. Control election timing and result release

## Troubleshooting

### Toast Plugin Issues
If you encounter `MissingPluginException` for fluttertoast:

1. **Run the setup script**: Double-click `setup.bat` for automatic setup
2. **Manual cleanup**:
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```
3. **Alternative**: The app includes fallback message handling that will use SnackBar if toast fails

### Common Issues

**"Flutter not recognized"**
- Ensure Flutter SDK is installed and added to PATH
- Download from: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows
- Add `C:\flutter\bin` to system PATH
- Restart terminal and run `flutter doctor`

**"Plugin not found"**
- Run `flutter clean` then `flutter pub get`
- Restart your IDE
- Try running on a different device/emulator

**"Registration/Admin Login not implemented"**
- These screens are now fully implemented!
- Registration includes full form validation
- Admin login includes secure authentication
- Home screen provides proper dashboard functionality

## Testing

Run tests with:
```bash
flutter test
```

## Next Steps

To complete the application:
1. Implement remaining UI screens
2. Add comprehensive form validation
3. Enhance admin interface
4. Add result visualization
5. Implement comprehensive testing
